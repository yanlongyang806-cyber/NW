Each game's icons are specified in three places: the Game Client, the game Launcher, and the installer.
It would be reasonable to merge them into one, but someone would have to go through the effort of
updating everything and making sure it worked with all applicable build processes.  Therefore, if you
update a game icon, you must update it in all three places.

Example:

Installer: C:\FightClub\tools\installer\Champions.ico
Launcher: C:\src\Core\CrypticLauncher\games\FC\FC.ico
Game Client: C:\src\FightClub\GameClient\FC.ico
