//this file lists names of ExprFuncTAbles which are "important" and should therefore get their own links on the front page of
//expr function server monitoring. Each one should have both an internal name and an external name separated by a colon, 
//so for instance Combat_Apply:Power_Requires, because there's an ExprFuncTable in code called Combat_Apply, but designers
//refer to it as "Power_Requires"
